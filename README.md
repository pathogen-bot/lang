# Translations for Pathogen
Pathogen uses [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) for localization.

## Contributing
Eventually I plan on trying to get [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/) setup but for now if you'd like to help translate, send me a message on [Discord](https://s.red-panda.red/discord) and I'll figure something out
